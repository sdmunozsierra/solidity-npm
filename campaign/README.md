# Campaign

Attempts to solve the Kickstarter problem when a bad actor 'steals' the money from the pool.

## Smart Contract

The proposition is to create a smart contract where the contributors can vote to release money to spending request.

## Run

### Test

To test the contracts in a terminal run:

```shell
npm run test
```

### From scratch

To create, compile and test from scratch in a terminal:

```shell
npm init
npm install web3@1.3.5
npm install solc@0.17
cd contracts
node compile.js
```
